======================

Tampermonkey exercises

The repository contains 5 simple exercises in three versions:

* `intermediate/` - version without any extra hints
* `beginner/` - version with a lot of hints, for people with minimal Javascript knowledge
* `solutions/` - solutions to the exercises

And also:

* `advanced/` - some ideas for more difficult tasks
* `blank.js` - blank Tampermonkey script

These scripts work both on Chrome with Tampermonkey and on
Firefox with Greasemoney, except on Firefox you might need to add some namespace to them.
